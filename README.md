soup-stats
==========

get stats about your soup.io account

Why
===
soup.io is a popular tumblelog. But like his big brother tumblr it lacks on statistic informations about your posts.
For example how many have you postet, how many repostet and what was reposted at most by others...

Target

- crawl soup.io pages
- get informations: how many ... pages, posts, reposts, friends, groups, followers, post dates
- get the type of the posts and reposts
- display some fancy charts
- save data to be sure not to crawl the pages every time
